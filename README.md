Technology Stacks:

React, Styled-Components(CSS in JS), javascript, browser localStorage

Notes:
1. used localStorage to to store user actvity in local storage. In browser console, type in "localStorage" to see user activities after progress through the application
2. there are styled-components files corresponding to most of the react children components
3. Did not have JSON file store on my local machine because its private and confidential. Instead, used Axios to fetch JSON object from git repository.
