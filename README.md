then.

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.


Technology Stacks:

React, Styled-Components(CSS in JS), javascript, browser localStorage

Notes:
1. used localStorage to store user activity in local storage. In the browser console, type in "localStorage" to see user activities after progress through the application
2. there are styled-components files corresponding to most of the react children components
3. Did not have JSON file store on my local machine because it's private and confidential. Instead, used Axios to fetch JSON object from git repository.
